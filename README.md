I'm trying to write my paper with care and parsimony. Nevertheless, I should first read as many papers as possible from academy pionners. After doing a thoroughly research, I believe I will be ready to begin writting my paper. We can not forget that before writing we should stroll for 60 minutes in order to ideas to flourish and to have a good breakfast.
